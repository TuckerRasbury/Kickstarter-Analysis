## Overview of Project
A client interested in the success of fundraising campaigns, Louise, has enlisted our assistance
to explore how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 
She recently conducted her on fundraising campaign and now has questions about how some factors 
contribute to the outcome of a campaign. The project goal here is to analyze and visualize
the relationships between the outcomes of different campaigns and the explanatory variables
Louise is interested in: a) launch dates, and b) [fundraising] goals. We are using the 
kickstarter dataset already provided to us so we are skipping over the stage of the 
project where we need to locate or clean data; and, we are focusing on analysis and creating informative charts.


### Purpose
First, analyze the dataset to search for the relationships between the following three 
variables: "outcome", "goal", and/or "launched date" with particular attention to the subcategory
plays. Second, visualize the meaningful relationships in the data for quick consumption by the client.


## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis conducted herein consists of two parts. The first looking at outcomes based on
launched date aggregates outcomes at month intervals and charts those figures over time to
show how the launch date of a project contributes to outcomes. The findings were significant and 
I will get into exactly how below. The second part of the analysis looked at outcomes based on 
fundraising goals. The data for this analysis consisted of a handmade table that used =countifs()
statements to locate and sum observations that fit multiple criteria. From there the findings were
turned into percentages and charted to show how "successful", "failed", and "canceled" campaigns
faired as they shifted from one bracket of fundraising goal amounts to another.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From looking over the Outcomes Based on Launch Date table, we can, first, conclude that campaigns 
for theater more often have "successful" outcomes than "failed" outcomes. Second we can 
conclude that the best time to launch a campaign is in Q2 of a year, circa April, May, and June.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
