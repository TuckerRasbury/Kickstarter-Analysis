# An-Analysis-of-Kickstarter-Campaigns
Herein lies analyzed data concerning fundraising campaigns, compiled for the benefit of our client, Louise. Our client intends to use this analysis to improve the likelihood of success of her own fundraising campaign. To assist her with her campaign, we analyzed fundraising campaign data using time series, geographic, and outcome variables available in the dataset and identified the central tendencies of the dataset by outcome.

---
In short, we found that campaigns supporting theater and more specifically plays launched in April, May, or June (or Q2 of a year) with a goal of approximately $5,000 would likely obtain 3/5ths of that amount or more and received more money per average pledge. However, we found that the higher the goal amount the lower the average amount per pledge.

---
I recommend that Louise categorizes her work under theaters and subcategorizes it as a play, putting the goal around 5,000 depending on her funding needs. Most importantly, the campaign should be launched in Q2 of the year. Outcomes change materially before and after Q2.
